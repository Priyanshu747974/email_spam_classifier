📧 Email Spam Classification — Project Description

Email Spam Classification is a machine learning–based system designed to automatically identify and filter unwanted or malicious emails. The goal is to distinguish spam emails (advertisements, phishing attempts, scams) from legitimate emails (important personal or professional messages) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

The system analyzes email content, including subject lines, message bodies, and metadata, to detect patterns commonly associated with spam. By training on labeled datasets, the model learns to recognize features such as suspicious keywords, excessive links, unusual formatting, and misleading language.
